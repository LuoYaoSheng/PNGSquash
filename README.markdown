# Hi! PNGSquash has been rewritten from the ground up in version 2.0, and is available exclusively to the App Store. Get it here:

## Description

![PNGSquash](https://github.com/msanders/PNGSquash/raw/master/readme-images/squash.png)

PNGSquash combines the top PNG compressors (that is, PNGCrush, OptiPNG, AdvPNG, and PNGOut*) into a streamlined interface for quick and effective compression. PNGSquash uses lossless compression (i.e., there is no change in quality), so it is ideal for web developers looking to save bandwidth.

*PNGOut cannot currently be bundled due to [licensing restrictions](http://www.advsys.net/ken/utils.htm#pngoutkziplicense), but there is a preference to enable it if you have it installed.
