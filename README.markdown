## Description

PNGSquash combines the top PNG compressors (that is, PNGCrush, OptiPNG, AdvPNG, and PNGOut*) into a streamlined interface for quick and effective compression. PNGSquash uses lossless compression (i.e., there is no change in quality), so it is ideal for web developers looking to save bandwidth.

Currently requires OS X 10.5 or later.

*PNGOut cannot currently be bundled due to [licensing restrictions](http://www.advsys.net/ken/utils.htm#pngoutkziplicense), but there is a preference to enable it if you have it installed.
